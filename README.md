    Below is a Salun map that I took from COD with changes that I think can make it more balanced and fun.

    the next map is called hills. It consists of a house, a garage and a backyard with a swimming pool. The atmosphere is meant to be reminiscent of the private homes in Beverly Hills

    This map is called Station. It's a two-story train depot. The map is located in an abandoned Soviet railroad station

    The last map is called Sakura. It's an Asian temple. The map is great for short range battles
